The previous graph had validation errors. Please fix them.

**Original Task:**
{{TASK}}

**Previous Graph (Attempt {{ATTEMPT}}):**
```json
{{PREVIOUS_GRAPH}}
```

**Validation Errors:**
{{VALIDATION_ERRORS}}

**Instructions:**

1. Carefully review each validation error
2. Identify the root cause of each error
3. Fix the errors while maintaining the original task intent
4. Ensure the corrected graph is valid and executable

Common validation errors and fixes:
- Missing required fields: Add all required properties
- Invalid node types: Use only "executor" or "router"
- Invalid modes: Use valid modes for each node type
- Invalid edge references: Ensure all edge source/target node IDs exist
- Schema violations: Match the exact schema structure and types
- Missing entry_point: Specify a valid entry point node ID

**Response Format:**

Provide your response as a JSON object:

{
  "reasoning": "Explain what was wrong and how you fixed it",
  "graph": {
    "nodes": [...],
    "edges": [...],
    "entry_point": "node_id"
  }
}

The corrected graph must pass schema validation. Double-check all node IDs, edge connections, and required fields.
